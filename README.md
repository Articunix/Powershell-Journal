Repository for powershell journal

This is my Powershell Journal. This journal will cover a list of fairly basic commands used within my powershell course to complete most labs and class work. These commands will be displayed alongside a description, syntax, example of the command in use aas well as a screenshot. There will be approximately 35 commands covered within this journal. Enjoy!
